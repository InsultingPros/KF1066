This repository contains crucial info for fixing [**Killing Floor 1**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1250/Killing_Floor/) game breaking / super annoying bugs.

!> Project is half finished and put into a stasis, since TWI doesn't care if this exists.

TODO:

1. Fix outdated youtube links.
2. ~~Accelerated players (when you hug and jump on several collisions and accelerate from them) one hit kill *ANY* zed.~~
3. ~~Projectiles vs players / zeds.~~
