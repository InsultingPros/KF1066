# General Information
Everyone can easily modify this game's memory and use grandpa age aimbots, hack programms. I almost don't care since there is a kickvote / ban system, but recently lot's of people started to bypass server bans. They just start the CheatEngine (or similar programm, doesn't matter), change 1 byte in their **SteamID** and they are free to join. Tho this value is one of the most important parts of game, and somehow game doesn't punish you on this trick.

## Possible fixes
### In General
And the most costly one tho.
1. Update **VAC** module. This will also help agains aimbots, over9000 radars and wallhacks. Won't last for too long but majority of exploiters will be banned and most likely stop trying to do that in future.
2. Obfuscate **SteamID**. This will also cut the amount of casual players who will be able to easily edit it's value.

### Minor: If we are online
Simply check and compare SteamID on every:
1. Server connection,
2. Map switch.
And if it differs from original value terminate the game session. It will be pretty fair against cheaters and keep our games not spoiled.

### Minor: If we are offline
Just don't care at all, since they can't do much on solo.
