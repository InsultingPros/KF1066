# General Information
Yeah, I know that **VAC** is not even enabled in KF, because everyone can easily modify game memory and use grandpa age aimbots. And I almost don't care since there is a kickvote / ban system. But lot's of people use that weakness to bypass the server bans. They just start the cheatengine (or similar programm, doesn't matter), change 1 byte in their **SteamID** and they are free to join. Game doesn't track your SteamID changes tho that value must not change in any circumstances. 

## Possible fixes
If enabling VAC module is too much work, just simply track SteamID changes on every wave / map / server change, main menu / settings, etc. And if it differs from original value terminate the game session. It will be pretty fair because you can't change it in other fair way. I believe this check can't be bypassed in an easy way, and this will help to keep fags from ruining our games.
