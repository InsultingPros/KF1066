# General Information
Yeah, I know that VAC is not even enabled in KF, because everyone can easily modify game memory and use grandpa age aimbots. And I almost don't care since there is a kickvote / ban system. But lot's of people use that weakness to bypass the server bans. They just start the cheatengine (or similar programm, doesn't matter), change 1 byte in their SteamID and they are free to join. Game doesn't track your SteamID changes tho that value must not change in any circumstances. If enabling VAC module is too much work, just simply track SteamID changes on every wave / map / server change, main menu / settings, etc. And if it differs from original value terminate the game session. I believe this check can't be bypassed in an easy way, and this will help to keep fags from ruining our games.
